# Introduction

`get_id_token.sh` is a Bash [shell script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) that will fetch an [OpenID
Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) `id_token` from Okta.

Below is an example of how `get_id_token.sh` could be used to fetch an
`id_token` for a user named "example.user" who is assigned to an Okta
application with the `client_id` of "aBCdEf0GhiJkLMno1pq2" in the
"example.oktapreview.com" Okta org:

Running the command above will return a JWT similar to the one
below:

# Installing

This shell script depends on `curl` and `jq` to run. The easiest way
to install these dependencies is to use the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/),
which will automatically install these dependencies for you if you
run the commands below.

> Note: While Nix is the easiest way to install the dependencies for
> this script, Nix will download over 600 [MiB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mebibyte) of packages to install
> `curl` and `jq`. If you don't want to use the Nix package manager, you
> can install `curl` and `jq` using your preferred package manager and
> then change the interpreter on the first line of `get_id_token.sh`
> from "`/usr/bin/env nix-shell`" to "`/bin/bash`"

Here is how to install `get_id_token.sh` on your system using the Nix
package manager on GNU/Linux or macOS systems:

1.  Install the Nix package manager:
    
        curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
2.  Download the `get_id_token.sh` shell script to your system
    
        git clone git@github.com:jpf/okta-get-id-token.git
3.  Change to the directory containing the `get_id_token.sh` shell
    script
    
        cd okta-get-id-token
4.  Run the shell script:
    
        ./get_id_token.sh -h

# Creating an Okta application for OpenID Connect

Follow the steps below if you haven't yet created an Okta
application with OpenID Connect support.

-   Log in to your Okta org as a user with administrator access.
-   Click on the "Admin" button.
-   Click on the "Add Applications" link in the right-hand "Shortcuts" sidebar.
-   Click on the "Create New App" button located on the left-hand side
    of the Add Application page.
-   A dialog box will open:
    -   For the purposes of this demonstration, leave "Platform" set to
        the "Web" option.
    -   Set the "Sign on method" to the "OpenID Connect" option.
    -   Click the "Create" button.
-   Select a name for your application. Use "get\_id\_token.sh" if you
    can't think of a good name.
-   Click "Next"
-   For the purposes of this demonstration, enter
    "<https://example.net/your_application>" as the Redirect URI.
-   Click "Finish"
-   You should now see the "General" tab of the OpenID Connect
    application that you just created.
-   Scroll down and copy the "Client ID" for the application that you created.
-   Click the "People" tab.
-   Click the "Assign to People" button.
-   Search for a user to assign to the application.
-   Click the "Assign" button for the user you want to assign to the application.
-   Click the "Save and Go Back" button.
-   Click the "Done" button.

Once you have created an Okta application and assigned a user to
that application, run the command in the section below to fetch an
`id_token` for that user.

# Using

Here is an example command that will fetch an `id_token` from Okta.

    ./get_id_token.sh -b 'https://example.okta.com' -c aBCdEf0GhiJkLMno1pq2 -u AzureDiamond -p hunter2 -o 'https://example.net/your_application'"

Here are what each of the options do:

**-b** is the **Base URL** for your Okta org.

**-c** is the **Client ID** for the Okta application that you created.

**-u** is the **Username** for a user assigned to the Okta application.

**-p** is the **Password** for the user.

**-o** is the **Origin**, one of the white listed URLs allowed to request an
`id_token` for the Client ID.

# How it works

At a high level, the `get_id_token.sh` script does the following:

1.  Initialize runtime dependencies using `nix-shell`
2.  Parse command line flags
3.  Fetch a [Session Token](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/sessions#session-token) from Okta via the Okta API
4.  Request an OpenID Connect `id_token` from the Okta API

Each section is covered in detail below.

## Initializing runtime dependencies using nix-shell

We start with a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) which specifies that this script is to
interpreted by `nix-shell` - which gives this script the ability to
configure its own dependencies automatically via the Nix package
manager.

    #! nix-shell -i bash -p curl -p jq
    # get_id_token.sh
    # A shell script which demonstrates how to get an OpenID Connect id_token from from Okta using the OAuth 2.0 "Implicit Flow"

## Parsing command line flags

Next we parse the command line flags into local variables. The
StackOverflow article on [Parsing arguments/options/flags in a bash
script](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8175000/parsing-arguments-options-flags-in-a-bash-script) has more details on parsing command line arguments in a Bash script.

    base_url=""
    client_id=""
    origin=""
    username=""
    password=""
    verbose=0
    
    while getopts ":b:c:o:u:p:v" OPTION
    do
        case $OPTION in
        b)
            base_url="$OPTARG"
        ;;
        c)
            client_id="$OPTARG"
        ;;
        o)
            origin="$OPTARG"
        ;;
        u)
            username="$OPTARG"
        ;;
        p)
            password="$OPTARG"
        ;;
        v)
            verbose=1
        ;;
        [?])
            echo "Usage: $0 -b base_url -c client_id -o origin -u username -p password" >&2
            echo ""
            echo "Example:"
            echo "$0 -b 'https://example.okta.com' -c aBCdEf0GhiJkLMno1pq2 -u AzureDiamond -p hunter2 -o 'https://example.net/your_application'"
            exit 1
        ;;
        esac
    done

## Fetching a Session Token from Okta via the Okta API

The code below uses `curl` to [URL encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) the redirect URL. For
example, if our redirect URL is `https://example.com` this code will
convert that string into `https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com`

    redirect_uri=$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out %{url_effective} --get --data-urlencode "$origin" "" | cut -d '?' -f 2)

If the `-v` flag was set, we print out some extra debugging information:

    if [ $verbose -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "Redirect URI: '${redirect_uri}'"
    fi

Once we have a properly encoded URL, we construct a `curl` command to
fetch an Okta session token from Okta using Okta's [/authn](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#primary-authentication) API endpoint:

    rv=$(curl --silent "${base_url}/api/v1/authn" \
              -H "Origin: ${origin}" \
              -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
              -H 'Accept: application/json' \
              --data-binary $(printf '{"username":"%s","password":"%s"}' $username $password) )
    session_token=$(echo $rv | jq -r .sessionToken )

If the `-v` flag was set, we print out some extra debugging information:

    if [ $verbose -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "First curl: '${rv}'"
    fi
    if [ $verbose -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "Session token: '${session_token}'"
    fi

## Requesting an OpenID Connect id\_token from the Okta API

Then, using our Okta session token, we construct a `curl` command to
make an [OAuth 2.0 authentication request](http://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oauth2.html#authentication-request) to Okta, asking for an `id_token`:

Note that we are requesting the "openid", "email", and "groups"
scopes" via the `scopes` query parameter.

    url=$(printf "%s/oauth2/v1/authorize?sessionToken=%s&client_id=%s&scope=openid+email+groups&response_type=id_token&response_mode=fragment&nonce=%s&redirect_uri=%s&state=%s" \
          $base_url \
          $session_token \
          $client_id \
          "staticNonce" \
          $redirect_uri \
          "staticState")

If the `-v` flag was set, we print out some extra debugging information:

    if [ $verbose -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "Here is the URL: '${url}'"
    fi

Then, we run the `curl` command, capturing the return value into a
local variable named `rv`:

    rv=$(curl --silent -v $url 2>&1)

If the `-v` flag was set, we print out some extra debugging
information:

    if [ $verbose -eq 1 ]; then
        echo "Here is the return value: "
        echo $rv
    fi

Finally, we parse out the `id_token` from the output of the `curl`
command, and print the value of the `id_token` on standard out:

    id_token=$(echo "$rv" | egrep -o '^< Location: .*id_token=[[:alnum:]_\.\-]*' | cut -d \= -f 2)
    echo $id_token
